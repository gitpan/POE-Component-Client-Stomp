Revision history for Perl extension POE::Component::Client::Stomp.

0.01  Thu Aug 30 13:48:39 2007
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
        -Axc -n POE::Component::Client::Stomp

    - Changed the module to be object oriented. I was having problems with
      sub classing the module to reduce complexity. I also wanted a dispatcher
      based on message types. This version does those things.

    - Changed event/method "handle_send" to "send_data", it seemed more
        syntactically correct with the new "gather_data" event/method.
      Added accessors for stomp, config, host and port.
      Added a log method, this method currently knows "warn" and "error"
        levels. This should be overridden by your class, for your prefered
        logger.
      Added a event/method "gather_data", it was needed to send the
        object to the method.
      Changed the internals to use the new accessors.
      Added a couple of examples.
      Made the reconnection code more robust. Probably needs more work.

      Fixed the "Broken pipe" error.
      Figured out how to require other modules. So Net::Stomp,
        POE::Filter::Stomp and POE::Component::Client::Stomp::Utils are
        now required modules.
      Added a method "handle_shutdown" this should be orridden if specific 
        stuff needs to be done when a shutdown has been initiated. By default 
        nothing will be done.
      Fixed a syntax mistake in the documentation.
      Added a granulated scheme for reconnection attempts.

0.05  17-Dec-2007 K.Esteb
      Fixed the "connection timeout" error.
      Fixed the documentation so it would format correctly.
      Added an event/method "connection_down" to signal when the active 
        connection is down. This needs to be overridden. By default nothing
        will be done.
      Added tests to make sure everything works correctly. These tests will
        fail if there is no MQ listening on port 61613 at localhost. Open
        to suggestions on how to fix this.
      Fixed Makefile.PL

0.06  16-Apr-2008 K.Esteb
      Bug fix release for RT #34743, #34742.
      POE is now a required module. Seems rather obvious, but I had some bug
	    reports on this one.
	  Removed 02_basic.t, Received a bug report on it not working. Sigh, 
	    release 0.05 explains why it may not work. So I guess this "fixes" 
		the above problem.
