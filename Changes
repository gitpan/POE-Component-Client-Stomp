	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-Axc -n POE::Component::Client::Stomp

0.02  Wed Oct 03 14:58:00 2007
    - Changed the module to be object oriented. I was having problems with
	  sub classing the module to reduce complexity. I also wanted a dispatcher
	  based on message types. This version does those things.
	  
0.03  Tue Oct 09 15:10:00 2007
    - Changed event/method "handle_send" to "send_data", it seemed more
	    syntactically correct with the new "gather_data" event/method.
	  Added accessors for stomp, config, host and port.
	  Added a log method, this method currently knows "warn" and "error"
	    levels. This should be overridden by your class, for your prefered
		logger.
	  Added a event/method "gather_data", it was needed to send the
	    object to the method.
	  Changed the internals to use the new accessors.
	  Added a couple of examples.
	  Made the reconnection code more robust. Probably needs more work.
